# Telco-Churn-Project
A project where IBMâ€™s 7 K-row Telco-Customer dataset is cleaned in Python and modeled with logistic regression and exports churn probabilities, and feeds an interactive Power BI dashboard that lets managers explore churn risk by contract length, internet service, and monthly charges.
